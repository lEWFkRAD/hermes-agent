"""Decode modifyOtherKeys / Kitty CSI-u escape sequences leaked into bare ``input()`` reads.

The classic CLI pushes extended-key reporting globally for the process —
xterm ``modifyOtherKeys`` level 2 (``CSI >4;2m``) and, on allowlisted
terminals, the Kitty keyboard protocol (``CSI >1u``); see
``cli.py::_enable_extended_enter_keys``.  While that mode is active the
terminal re-encodes every *modified* key:

* modifyOtherKeys=2: ``ESC[27;<mod>;<codepoint>~``
* Kitty CSI-u:       ``ESC[<codepoint>;<mod>u``

``prompt_toolkit`` decodes both via its ``ANSI_SEQUENCES`` table (which
``hermes_cli.pt_input_extras`` fills in), but Python's builtin ``input()``
does **not** — it returns the raw escape text.  Every bare ``input()`` prompt
reached while the mode is active therefore receives garbage whenever the user
types a shifted character (issue #97975).

``decode_modified_key_sequences`` is the pure string transform that fixes
that: it maps each sequence back to the literal character the user pressed
when the modifier chain is Shift-only, and passes everything else through
unchanged.  ``safe_input`` wraps builtin ``input()`` with that transform.

# The modifier parameter is a bitmask plus one: shift=1, alt=2, ctrl=4,
# super=8, hyper=16, meta=32, caps=64, num=128. Plain Shift is therefore
# exactly 2. In particular, Kitty CSI-u mod 3 is Alt and mod 4 is Shift+Alt;
# neither is safe to turn into a literal character.
#
# Under modifyOtherKeys the terminal applies CapsLock/NumLock *before*
# encoding (shift+caps on 'T' sends codepoint 116 = 't'), so the caps/num
# bits are not lock noise — 65/129 are genuinely un-shifted keys and must
# pass through untouched.
